# Q&A

##  How and when we need to use "kinit" and "module init" commands.  

[Managing Data on Colossus](Managing Data on Colossus)
For security reasons the /cluster/project/pX and /cluster/software filesystems require additional
Kerberos authentication. Whenever you ssh into one of the submit hosts, you'll need to authenticate
using your password. You're then given a ticket for the duration of 10 hours. Using this ticket
you can access the filesystems without having to provide your password again for the duration
of the ticket, when it is automatically renewed up to a week. You can list your current ticket
status using:

```
klist

```
{: .bash}


```
-bash-4.2$ klist
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1555
Default principal: xx-user@TSD.USIT.NO

{: .output}


```
-bash-4.2$ cd /cluster/project/p33

```
{: .bash}

```
-bash: cd: /cluster/project/p33: No such file or directory

```
{: .output}

The above outputs indicates that yu have nt obtained a key or your Kerberos key has expired. 
If you face the error use the **knit** command to obtain a key

```
-bash-4.2$ knit
Password for xx-user@TSD.USIT.NO:

-bash-4.2$ module init
